                Man through his scientific genius has been able to draw distance and
                save time and space. He has been able to carry highways through the
                stratosphere. We read just the other day that a rocket plane went 1900
                miles in one hour. Twice as fast as the speed of sound. This is the
                new age. Bob Hope has described this new age, this jet age; it is an
                age in which planes will be moving so fast that we will have a
                non-stop flight from New York to Los Angeles, when you start out you
                might develop the hiccups and you will hic in New York and cup in Los
                Angeles. This is an age in which it will be possible to leave Tokyo on
                a Sunday morning and arrive in Seattle, Washington on the preceding
                Saturday night. When your friends meet you at the airport and ask what
                time did you leave Tokyo, you will have to say I left tomorrow. That
                is this new age.  We live in one world geographically. We face the
                great problem of making it one spiritually.
                <br/>
                Through our scientific means we have made of the world a
                neighborhood and now the challenge confronts us through our
                moral and spiritual means to make of it a brotherhood. We must
                live together, we are not independent we are interdependent. We
                are all involved in a single process. Whatever affects one
                directly affects all indirectly for we are tied together in a
                single progress. We are all linked in the great chain of
                humanity.
